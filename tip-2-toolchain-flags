If you are trying to build code for a 32-bit RISC-V rv32i core using a 64-bit compiler 
(as most distributions provide) then you need to add  -mabi=ilp32 -march=rv32i  to put 
it into rv32i mode.

If you are using a "linux" variant compiler to create a bare metal binary, you need to 
remove the build ID (which breaks the flat binary output) by using  ,--build-id=none  after  -Wl .
